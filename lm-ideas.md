# Leevie's Ideas:
----

## Craigslist Alert:
App that interfaces with CL API. 
User enters a search and it alerts them (mobile alert) when a new. item matching that query, is submitted.



## Beer/Food Pairing App:
App that pairs food with beer. 

User searches for a certain beer (some beer API),
returns info about that beer.  Can link it to another API that shows where to purchase (possibly Untappd's API?  Beer Advocate?)
